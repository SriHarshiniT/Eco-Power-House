# Eco-Power-House
Eco Power House is a renewable energy prototype that combines solar, wind, hydro, and piezoelectric power generation into a single system.
It uses LDR-based solar tracking, wind direction detection via radar, and piezoelectric sensors to harvest mechanical energy.
An ESP32 microcontroller manages sensors, motors, and energy storage in a lithium-ion battery.
This project demonstrates a multi-source clean energy solution for sustainable power generation.
